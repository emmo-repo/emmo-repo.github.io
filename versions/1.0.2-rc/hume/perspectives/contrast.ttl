Physicalistic: the electromagnetic pulses can be defined as individual A (of type Field) and the strip of paper coming out a printer receiver can be defined as individual B (of type Matter).
Data: both A and B are also DiscreteData class individuals. In particular they may belong to a MorseData class, subclass of DiscreteData.
Perceptual: B is an individual belonging to the graphical entities expressing symbols. In particular is a formula under the MorseLanguage class, made of a combination of . and - symbols.
Semiotics: A and B can be signs if they refers to something else (e.g. a report about a fact, names)."""@en,
