Mereology based on such items is called atomistic mereology.

However, in order not to confuse the lexicon between mereology and physics (in which an atom is a divisible physical entity) we prefer to call it 'elementary', recalling the concept of elementary particle coming from the standard particles model.

More than one numeral stands for the same number.
In the EMMO abstract entities do not exists, and numbers are simply defined by other numerals, so that a number is the class of all the numerals that are equivalent (e.g. 3 and 0011 are numerals that stands for the same number).
Or alternatively, an integer numeral may also stands for a set of a specific cardinality (e.g. 3 stands for a set of three apples). Rational and real numbers are simply a syntactic arrangment of integers (digits, in decimal system).
The fact that you can't give a name to a number without using a numeral or, in case of positive integers, without referring to a real world objects set with specific cardinality, suggests that the abstract concept of number is not a concept that can be practically used.
For these reasons, the EMMO will consider numerals and numbers as the same concept."""@en ;

This semiotic process occurs at meta-level: it's how I use the EMMO as tool for a direct representation of the world, understandable by others ontologists.

The semiotic process within EMMO:
My friend looks at the same cloud and says: \"It is an elephant\".
I use the EMMO to record this experience by declaring:
    - my friend as MyFriend individual, belonging to 'Interpreter' classes
    - the sound of the word \"elephant\" as an acoustical perception individual named ElephantWord, belonging to 'Perceptual'
    - a relation hasSign between Cloud and ElephantWord, that makes ElephantWord also belonging to 'Sign' class and Cloud belonging also to 'Object' class
    - a 'Semiosis' individual called MyFriendElephantCloud that hasParticipant: Cloud, ElephantWord and MyFriend, respectively as object, sign and interpreter.

This perspective is based on human characterization of perceptions.

In other words, a 'Perceptual' is a meta-object, meaning that is addressed by the ontologist (the meta-interpreter) in a semiotic process occurring outside the EMMO. The 'Perceptual' branch is here to facilitate the connection between an individual and the real-world object for which it stands for.

A 'Perceptual' can stand for another object in an EMMO described semiotic process (acting as sign or as object), just like a word on a paper (the perceptual object) may refer semiotically to another object. However, a perceptual is not necessarily a 'Sign' (e.g. a line sketched on a blackboard is a recognizable 'Perceptual' but it may stand for nothing).

A 'Perceptual' becomes an 'Object', when it is part of a 'Semiotic' process described by the ontologist within the EMMO, and it's done always specifying for which interpreter this relation occurs."""@en ;

For the EMMO ontologist the whole universe is the most comprehensive object. World objects are then sub-parts of the universe.
The fundamental distinction between world objects, upon which the EMMO is based, is self-connectedness: a world object can be self-connected xor not self-connected.
Parthood relations do not change dimensionality of the world object: every part of a world object is another world object and always retains a 4D dimensionality character.
The smallest part of a world object (i.e. a part that has no proper parts) is called a 'Quantum' individual. Quantum individuals are the fundamental causal constituents of the universe. They are no-dimensional, and their aggregation makes 4D objects emerge  from their causal structure.
It follows that, for the EMMO, world objects of dimensionality lower than 4D (e.g. surfaces, lines) do not exist.
In the EMMO there are no relations such as occupiesSpace, since objects are themselves the 4D regions.
An object always possess 4-dimensions. It follows from the fact that perception is always unfolding in time (e.g. you always have an aperture time when you take a picture or measure a property. Instantaneous perceptions are idealizations (abstractions) or a very small time measurement)."""@en ;

However that's not possible in general, since we will finally end to temporal parts whose temporal extension is so small that the connectivity relations that define the object will no longer hold. That's the case when the temporal interval is lower than the interval that characterize the causality interactions between the object parts.
In other terms, if the time span of a temporal part is lower than the inverse of the frequency of interactions between the constituents, then the constituents in such temporal part are not connected. The object is no more an object, neither an item, but simply a collection of fundamental parts.
To overcome this issue, we can identify an minimum holistic temporal part (a lower time interval value), below which a specific definition for an object type does not hold anymore, that is called a fundamental."""@en ;

- object (focus on spatial configuration)
- process (focus on temporal evolution)

The concepts of endurant and perdurant implicitly rely on the concept of instantaneous 3D snapshot of the world object, that in the EMMO is not allowed since everything extends in 4D and there are no abstract objects. Moreover, time is a measured property in the EMMO and not an objective characteristic of an object, and cannot be used as temporal index to identify endurant position in time. 

For this reason an individual in the EMMO can always be classified both endurant and perdurant, due to its nature of 4D entity (e.g. an individual may belong both to the class of runners and the class of running process), and the distinction is purely semantic.  In fact, the object/process distinction is simply a matter of convenience in a 4D approach since a temporal extension is always the case, and stationarity depends upon observer time scale. For this reason, the same individual (4D object) may play the role of a process or of an object class depending on the object to which it relates.

Nevertheless, it is useful to introduce categorizations that characterize persistency through continuant and occurrent concepts, even if not ontologically but only cognitively defined. This is also due to the fact that our language distinguish between nouns and verbs to address things, forcing the separation between things that happens and things that persist.

This perspective provides classes conceptually similar to the concepts of endurant and perdurant (a.k.a. continuant and occurrent). We claim that this distinction is motivated by our cognitive bias, and we do not commit to the fact that both these kinds of entity “do really exist”. For this reason, a whole instance can be both process and object, according to different cognitive approaches (see Wonderweb D17).

The distinction between endurant and perdurant as usually introduced in literature (see BFO SPAN/SNAP approach) is then no more ontological, but can still be expressed through the introduction of ad hoc primitive definitions that follow the interpreter endurantist or perdurantist attitude."""@en ;
