    rdfs:comment """The EMMO conceptualises the world using the primitive concepts of causality and parthood. Parthood is about the composition of world entities starting from other more fundamental entities. Causality is about the interactions between world entities.
The quantum is the smallest indivisible part of any world entity. Quantum individuals are the fundamental causal constituents of the universe, since it is implied that causality originates from quantum-to-quantum interactions. Quantums are no-dimensional, and their aggregation makes spacetime emerge from their causal structure. We can think of a quantum as an elementary particle after and interaction and before another interaction.
Causality between macro entities (i.e. entities made of more than one quantum) is explained as the sum of the causality relations between their quantum constituents. Fundamental interactions (quantum fields) are represented as symmetric causality relation between macro entities, while classical interactions are mediated by chain of quantums (i.e. elementary particles).
The fundamental distinction between world entities is causality self-connectedness: a world entity can be self-connected xor not self-connected depending on the causality network of its fundamental components.
Void regions do not exist in the EMMO. In other words there is no spacetime without entities and spacetime emerges as relational property not as a self-standing entity). Entities are not placed in space or time: space and time are measured quantities, always relative between entities and are measured. In other words, space and time relations originates from causality interactions."""@en,

    rdfs:comment """A world entity is direct causally self-connected if any two parts that make up the whole are direct causally connected to each other. In the EMMO, topological connectivity is based on causality.
All physical objects, i.e. entities whose behaviour is explained by physics laws, are represented only by items. In other words, a physical object part is embedded in a direct causal graph that provides always a path between two of its parts.
Members of a collection lack such direct causality connection, i.e. they do not constitute a physical object.
Following graph theory concepts, the quantums of an item are all connected together within a network of causal relations, forming a connected causal graph. A collection is then a set of disconnected graphs."""@en,
