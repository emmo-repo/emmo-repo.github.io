For example, a line can be expressed by:

b) a line drawn with a pencil on a paper, which is simply a 'graphical' object
c) a set of axioms, when the properties of a line are inferred by the interpreter reading them, that are both 'graphical' and also 'formula'

The case a) is a geometrical and mathematical, b) is geometrical and pictorial, while c) is geometrical and a composition of idiomatic strings."""@en ;
