Points that can be discussed:
  * Units are individuals 
      - this allows assigning data properties for unit conversions and standard symbol
  * The hierarchy of data properties replicate object properties
      - This duplicates labels, which should be avoided. Could we use two different naming conventions for object and data properties?
      - If this is a good idea, the toplevel hierarchy of data properties should be defined in emmo-base and not in emmo-units
  * We included dimensionless among the basis units. 
      - This allows us to require that all physical quantities must have a unit, even those that are dimensionless.
  * Derived properties will be included in separate modules, probably categorised after unit system, like emmo-si-units, emmo-natural-units, emmo-cgs-units, emmo-ucs-units, etc. 
    - should emmo-si-units be included by default in emmo.owl? It will probably be rather large
    - the other unit systems should probably not be included in emmo.owl. Should we but them in a separate folder "unit-systems" or "extra"? Should we add a new toplevel owl file call emmo-all.owl that includes them?
  * emmo-si-units should in addition to the units also define the corresponding derived physical properties
    - how should we deal with unit prefixes (... kilo, hecto,  deci...)? Should we add
  * Would emmo-base-units be a better name of this module?
