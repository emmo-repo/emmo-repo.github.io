It will continue to exists as state as long as the ice is completely melt at t = t_end. The new state will be completely made of water. Between t_start and t_end there is an exchange of molecules between the ice and the water, but this does not affect the existence of the two states.

If we partition the existent in my glass as ice surrounded by several molecules (we do not use the object water as direct part) then the appearance of a molecule coming from the ice will cause a state to end and another state to begin.")
AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment emmo-direct:EMMO_36c79456_e29c_400d_8bd3_0eedddb82652 "Direct partitions declaration is a choice of the ontology developer that choses the classes to be used as direct parts, according to its own world view.

A 'state' can always be direct partitioned in 'elementary'-s and 'void' or 'physical'.

e.g. the water in my glass can be seen as a single object without declaring direct parts, or as made of H2O molecules direct parts.")
AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment emmo-direct:EMMO_36c79456_e29c_400d_8bd3_0eedddb82652 "The definition of 'state' implies that its direct parts (i.e. 'physicals') are not gained or lost during its temporal extension (they exist from the left to the right side of the time interval), so that the granularity of a 'state' is constant.

This does not mean that there cannot be a change in the internal structure of the 'state' direct parts. It means only that this change must not affect the existence of the direct part itself.

There is no change in granularity or cardinality of direct parts within a 'state'.

Also, the 'state' must cover all the time interval between two successive cardinality changes.

The use of spatial direct parthood in 'state' definition means that a 'state' cannot overlap in space another 'state'.")
AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment emmo-direct:EMMO_36c79456_e29c_400d_8bd3_0eedddb82652 "The usefulness of 'state' is that it makes it possible to describe the evolution in time of an 'existent' in terms of series of 'state'-s that can take into account the disappearance or appearance of parts within a 'physical'. 

A 'state' is a recognizable granularity level of matter, in the sense that its direct parts do not appear or disappear within its lifetime as it can be for a generic 'existent'.")
